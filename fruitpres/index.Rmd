## Benefits of Eating Fruit
Who can resist the bright colors and sweet taste of a piece of fruit?
But fruit is more than tasty--it's also good for you. Check out these facts about the nutrients found in fruit:
- **Potassium** may help maintain a healthy blood pressure.
- **Dietary fiber** from fruits helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart disease. 
- **Vitamin C** is important for growth and repair of all body tissues, helps heal cuts and wounds, and keeps teeth and gums healthy.
- **Folate** (folic acid) helps the body form red blood cells.

- Considers income, gender, age, weight, education and race/ethnicity.
- Based on data compiled by the USDA.
